      "\n",
      "I would say KJSCE is among the best colleges in Mumbai. Back during my time it was under Mumbai University. Infrastructure-wise KJSCE is very good and has a large area of land. I think its second largest after the IIT Bombay campus because I don’t any other private college in Mumbai has that big of an area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of my batch mates were like me who had been preparing for IIT JEE and hadn’t made it through. So I will say its safe to say for most of us, KJSCE was not a dream college but a secondary option incase we didn’t get into a tier one college like IIT, NIT or BITS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Teaching faculty at KJSCE is mediocre and probably even the best engineering colleges in the world have mediocre teaching faculty because a college’s reputation and ranking is mainly on the quality of students they admit.\n",
      "\n",
      "KJSCE has a minority quota for Gujarati’s, so you all will find many 50% admits are Gujjus and rest are merit admits. One or two are NRI/Gulf seats too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I had a good time at KJSCE and made good friends. Most of my batch mates went to the US for Masters in CS or MIS and now working there only.\n",
      "Full Answer for 'Which one is better: the K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering or the Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology?': For your question the first thing you need to consider is the proximity of the college from our home (in case you don't plan to avail hostel facility) as on overall ranking basis many sources rank the two colleges quite close to each other and hence you'd really want to reduce your traveling time and focus more on your studies/other misc. activities.\n",
      "Secondly, if traveling isn't an issue to you, you may consider the following points:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Infrastructure:Both colleges have an excellent infrastructures which you can see on their respective websites/visit them personally.\n",
      "Placements:The average placements of both colleges lie around 3-3.5 lacs although there have been cases of some students getting about 24 lakh packages in kjsce recently (last year). Also some students secure out-of -campus placements which may go sky high like around 50lakhs. So its basically the students bio that matters in this scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "University:Here's the major difference where Kjsce definitely holds the upper hand. Vesit comes under Mumbai University whereas Kjsce has been an autonomous institute since the past two years (this year being the second batch of complete autonomy). How this helps is that the subjects are better designed for personal growth than in case of MU. Moreover, this allows the college to control the exam conduction which has definitely been better than MU. Also you get a longer vacation for extra curricular activities like projects/internships which come in handy highlighting your resume.\n",
      "Sports:No comparison!Kjsce has an extremely well reputed football turf and a very good badminton court as well. Also the running track is in accordance with the university standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Campus: Kjsce has probably one of the biggest campuses as compared to nearby colleges in mumbai except for IIT-B which has way bigger one .\n",
      "\n",
      "So basically its upto you which college you want to choose as both are pretty good colleges. Hope I was helpful. Cheers!\n",

      "\n",
      "Being from the first autonomous batch in KJSCE from 2014-2018 I would say that the autonomous status for the college is great. The curriculum is better than Mumbai University. (MU)\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that you can explore and learn new courses and work on the latest technologies rather than following the useless Techmax books which are old and of no use. The fees are comparatively more but as compared to the maintenance of the huge campus they seem quite satisfactory. Besides KJSCE has a strong network of alumni globally and many good universities abroad are already aware of the college which will help during your applications if you’re planning to opt for further studies after your engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about placements, more companies will come to recruit considering the past history and new courses that the students will be studying. So to conclude, the review of KJSCE is great and better than most of the normal MU engineering colleges out there currently in Mumbai. This will even set you apart as there are only a few universities in Mumbai which have the autonomous tag currently. Hope this helps, good luck with the admissions.\n",

      "You will surely regret taking this field if:\n",
      "\n",
      "You can’t understand basic concepts of electrical circuits, elementary physics, mathematics and basic computer programming.\n",
      "Have no interest in Electronics whatsoever and no interest in Engineering\n",
      "You only want a job in this domain, without any hard work and relevant skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, you will have to see what your interest is. In Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (say ENTC), you will be studying electronics circuits , signals and how to generate/analyze/detect/filter them, electronic devices; how do they operate and are manufactured, modern processor, controllers and how to develop basic systems with them. And many more topics like Control System theory, Electromagnetics etc. Why am mentioning all these ? Because understand that at the end of engineering you will be using this knowledge to step into electronics industries, or would be choosing one of the topics and going ahead with research or specialization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I don’t know what people have told you, but from my experience, there is good demand of Electronics Engineers, especially in India. But note, we need competent engineers, not degree holders. ENTC engineering is not easy, and it involves concepts of computer science, electrical and sometimes mechanical engineering along with electronics. You need to study and understand the concepts involved and also how they are applied commercially. Once you are skilled in your domain, you can see that there are opportunities. There are even opportunities in startups if you are interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "One reason why people might be telling you that there’s no scope and few jobs, may be because today there are too many CS/IT related jobs when compared to Electronics engineering (in India). Unfortunately today’s scenario is that many electronics engineers join IT industries. This is giving the impression that we don’t have jobs for electronics engineers. Comparatively, yes, jobs are less in Electronics domain when compared with CS/IT branch. But this doesn’t means you will regret taking Electronics. It just means that you will have to be more skilled than others, and look harder for company/organization that suits your interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "SO check your interests, and go ahead. If you are interested, skilled and competent, then there are plethora of opportunities and exciting jobs waiting for you. You will never regret your decision. If you have interest in Electronics, there’s no better time than now to step in this domain. We are in the process of watching electronics revolutionize our lifestyle and you just might get a front row seat in this spectacular show.\n",
      "Full Answer for 'Can you share your experience of counselling at K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering (Mumbai)?': It was after my boards that I have decided to pursue MBBS, alone. All my friends decided to take admission in different colleges.Then I Searched for coaching classes and joined the one I found best. All three subjects in different classes, all in separate corner of city. I used to go out early in the morning, attend one class, drive for about 30 minutes, attend second class, then study for few hours, then drive for another class. Then return home at the time of dinner, study, sleep then next day repeat. For almost 5 months it was my routine. For some last months I studied madly.\n",

I don't wanted to. I wanted to take one more attempt.They forced me to join college. For their sake I joined. But I wasn't happy nor excited. only 10 days went, and I was unable to continue.I used to sit alone, didn't talk to anyone, didn't gave efforts to any tasks in college. I don't no why but it became impossible for me to continue. I told my parents, this time my sister took my side and argued with them to allow me one more attempt. They finally agreed. I started preparing for next exam, and a lot tragedies happened after that but finally after 3rd attempt I got Medical college. Currently I am answering this in between preparation of anatomy paper of university exams.\n",

Somaiya College and SIES College for an electrical engineer?': Before you make a choice, I'd like to let you know that both colleges are great for the branches you've mentioned. But here are a few favtors that you should consider, before you decide :\n",
      "\n",
      "KJ Somaiya is an autonomous Institution and is now a little more prestigious than the Mumbai University.\n",
      "Attendance isn't strict in KJ as far as I know. It is pretty strict in Vivekanand.\n",
      "Electronics and Telecommunications has an upper edge over pure electronics, period.\n",
      "If you're in the Mumbai University, you don't have to worry much about your exams as it usually includes a big repetition of the previous year's papers. This is not the case in KJ. The papers are much harder and the exam schedules are way more hectic.\n",
      "MU gives 5 days of holiday before every semester paper. KJ only gives one or two days. This makes the exams very hectic in KJ.\n",
      "\n",
      "The semester ends in KJ before MU, as their papers get over very early. Kj students get as much as two months of leave after every semester whereas MU students get barely one month. One can use these vacations for doing internships and co curricular courses that have a positive effect on one's resume. However, I would like to mention that one month is sufficient for doing internships.\n",
      "\n",
      "So basically, it is a pretty even match between the two. The deciding factor must be one's interest in a particular field. That makes a world of a difference. So you should listen to your heart and think whether the telecommunications part of the industry interests you more or core electronics.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make it easier for you, I'll tell you a little bit about both the branches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both branches are very similar to each other.\n",
      "The basic concepts are the same.\n",
      "Electronics also has a few subjects of telecommunications such as Digital Communication, and vice versa.\n",
      "However, electronics will teach you more about electronic components, circuits and more basic ideas needed in general electronics.\n",
      "Telecommunications will try to give you a deeper perspective of communication technologies.\n",

      "\n",

      "Full Answer for 'Which is the best college for an MCA in Maharashtra?': VJTI Mumbai is considered as the best college for MCA in Maharashtra. It's a government college which has low fee, a brand, placement is very good and most important its cut off is too high under MAH CET. So you get an opportunity to compete with the good minds to be a part of this college and after admission also. This is a state funded college so unfortunately there is no seat for OMS (Other than Maharashtra State) candidate, even if you score 100 percentile. In every state funded colleges of Maharashtra there is not a single seat for OMS candidate for MCA and B.Tech. University of Pune is also a very good choice for MCA but it has less than 15 seats for OMS candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion :- If you are an OMS candidate you have to take admission only in a private college (some private colleges are good in Pune) in Maharashtra but fortunately if you are not then the best college is waiting for you dear.\n",

      "A million dollar question like this requires some better answers and not just a list of colleges based on cut-offs and placement figures. This may help others as even I had the same questions when I decided to take CS in Mumbai. I have studied in Tier 2/3 college as people like to call it. But have friends across the city studying in various colleges. So my answer will be based on their experiences and my experiences. So here is a list, assuming question doesn’t specifically asks about Mumbai University.\n",
      "IIT Bombay :\n",
      "I don’t need to rant about IIT-B as the top most college in Mumbai and India for CS. If you get in then congrats and be prepared to work hard. But the thing that makes IIT-B stand apart is the crowd of students that go there.\n",
      "The professors, curriculum, labs, seniors and good coding culture makes it a perfect combination for any CS student. And placements are well known across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "VJTI, KJSCE, SPIT [Autonomous Colleges]:\n",
      "Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute [VJTI], K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering [KJSCE], Sardar Patel Institute of Technology [SPIT] are all best autonomous institutes in Mumbai and one of the best when it comes to comparison in Mumbai based colleges.\n",
      "\n",
      "VJTI : This is a government college and cheapest amongst all the colleges in Mumbai. It’s been consistently ranked 1 in Mumbai for a lot of reasons but I take all rankings with a bag of salt. VJTI is so good because the toppers in state entrance exam come here and when you have the best talent in the state, your results are bound to be good. But the teachers are a real letdown as far as what I have heard. Labs are below average and location is good. Fees are very low at around Rs. 70,000 PA. It is often a top destination for the all the best companies like Microsoft,etc and the top packages often hover around 20–24LPA. And the alumni presence is strong everywhere. You get it, go for it.\n",
      "KJSCE,SPIT : Both the colleges got autonomy in the recent years and have been performing good in all the departments. But be ready to burn a hole of approx Rs. 1.25 - 1.75 LPA for the fees. But if you get in, its mildly justifies the fees. Students are smart, placements are good. Teachers are good to average as like everywhere else. Also good in terms of placement and all the big names come here.\n",
      "\n",
      "DJSCE,TSCE,FCRIT,VESIT [Mumbai University]:\n",
      "Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering [DJSCE], Thadomal Shahani Engineering College [TSEC], Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering [FCRIT], Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology [VESIT] are all Mumbai University affiliated colleges and are considered very good after the autonomous bunch above. These are good colleges where you can get a decent shot at good companies. The fees are in range of Rs. 1 – 1.5 LPA which is average fees in Mumbai colleges.\n",
      "\n",
      "DJSCE : They have grown in quality by leaps and bounds in a matter of years in all departments. And their committees and festivals are very good. Students are smart and teachers are mostly good. Placements are also top notch with the likes of JPMC, Morgan Stanley, etc. I even met a guy who got internship at Microsoft. So its going to catch up the lot above very soon.\n",
      "TSEC : They have been the same all these years. Big name, good students and good placements with big names. Can’t go wrong with this one.\n",
      "FCRIT : They have two campuses in Mumbai one in Bandra and the other in Vashi. I have friend in both the campuses. I’ll speak for the Vashi campus first. My friend quotes it beautifully in one word; “JAIL”. Yes! That’s what people feel in Vashi campus. Hardly any freedom, very very strict attendance policies. Everyone is just focused on rote learning [*Maggus*] and very few are good. My suggestion is avoid this one if you want some degree of freedom in college. The Bandra campus is better but attendance is also strict here to varying degrees. The placements are average that’s what I’ve heard. “Go here at your own risk.”\n",
      "VESIT : Good college with good placements and haven’t heard anything highly negative about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "TCET,ACE,SFIT,RGIT,VCET [Mumbai University] aka The Big Five:\n",
      "Thakur College of Engineering and Technology [TCET], Atharva College of Engineering [ACE], St. Francis Institute of Technology [SFIT], Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology [RGIT], Vidyavardhini College of Engineering and Technology [VCET] are all colleges belonging to more or less the same clan. The thing that’s common in all of them is placements. The majority of the students get placed in the mass recruiter companies and hence they achieve good placement statistics. Without the mass recruiters, it will tough for them to place them, which true for rest of the colleges in Mumbai also. The fees ranges from Rs 93,000 - 1,30,000 which is in the low to average category. The students are a mixed bad in all these colleges with bright spots here and there.\n",
      "\n",
      "TCET : The costliest in the lot but also good infrastructure in return. Has a name in the western suburbs and good placement record. I remember WorkApps had come here with a 30LPA pacakge and they selected one person. Most of the crowd gets placed in the mass recruiters here. But there are exceptions always, I knew some very good people in that college.\n",
      "ACE : [*This can be a little biased view as I studied here*] “Bang for the Buck” is what I could like to describe Atharva as it is one of the most affordable private colleges in Mumbai but the fees are rising every year. I write a whole answer on pros and cons of being here but I’ll keep it short here. The CS department has a very good HOD and he supports the students in the department very well. There are various committees promoting good coding culture and seniors were good. Attendance is little lenient as compared to others and labs are super cool. Students vary a lot and this is a problem. Some are interested while others just come to do pass the time. But a huge potential in the department as all the teachers are good to average supporting students. [*I stop the rant here*]\n",
      "SFIT : A close cousin of FRCIT with very strict attendance requirements of 75% which is a little harsh on the students. Teachers are average and so are the students. Nothing exceptional to speak for.\n",
      "RGIT : This one was a good name in the past but the college has lost its shine becoming a stagnant college. I had friends here and as per them its nothing noteworthy. Teachers are ok and so are placements. Not so strict on the attendance front. Good to average infrastructure.\n",
      "VECT : The lowest performing in the lot. Average to bad infrastructure. Average professors and nothing much to say about placements or students either. The college is good for Mechanical as that’s what I’ve heard. Location is far from Mumbai but very near from the railway station.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other noteworthy names in Mumbai include Vidyalankar Institute of Technology [VIT], Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & Engineering [MPSTME], Shah & Anchor Kutchhi Engineering College [SAKEC], Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology [RAIT]\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is a caveat to every college in the list. No matter whether you go to IIT-B or RGIT, you have the same amount of time and resources at your disposal. So only the college name will not get you to success, its your own hardwork that will get you there. Also having a small group of like minded friends affects a lot and helps you in developing yourself. I know people in VJTI who work in Microsoft as well as in Accenture. So take all the reviews and rankings with a bag of salt and just work hard in college. And most importantly, in CS internet is your biggest friend and biggest enemy. So you should chose carefully.\n",
      "Good Luck.\n",
