"Dissatisfied with the placements this year, good campus and hostels, good exposure . Placements : The placements are pretty decent for computer and IT branch. But for EXTC and other branches it is very hard for them to be placed. If you are from computer and IT, you can expect a package of 9-10 LPA, if you perform well and have the skills. Many companies that are in Fintech come to hire. But the placement percentage is decreasing year by year, don't know if it is due to recession or not.
